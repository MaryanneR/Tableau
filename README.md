The Tableau data visualization projects located on my Tableau Public profile highlight my ability to explore and analyze data and use eye-catching yet informative visualizations to communicate those insights in an easy-to-understand manner.

The Tableau projects posted to my Tableau Public profile are coursework completed for the Tableau Training for Data Science course by Kirill Eremenko (SuperDataScience) and the Ligency I Team hosted on Udemy.
